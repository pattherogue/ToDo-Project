Title of Project: "Interactive Todo App with LocalStorage Integration"

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to develop an interactive todo application using DOM access and event handling. The key functionalities included enabling users to add new tasks through a form, mark tasks as completed (with text strikethrough), and remove tasks. Additionally, the project aimed to implement localStorage to persistently store user's todos, ensuring that they remain intact even after a page refresh.

Tools Used:
1. HTML: Used to create the structure and user interface of the todo app.
2. CSS: Employed for styling and visual enhancements to improve user experience.
3. JavaScript: Utilized for DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing the core functionality of the todo app.
4. localStorage: Employed to store and retrieve todos locally in the user's browser.

Results/Outcomes of the Project:
The project resulted in the successful creation of an interactive todo application that met the specified requirements. Users could add new todos, mark them as completed with text strikethrough, and remove todos effortlessly. The integration of localStorage ensured that todos persisted even after the page was refreshed, providing a seamless user experience. This project served as an excellent opportunity to showcase proficiency in web development, JavaScript, and front-end technologies, while also demonstrating the ability to implement and manage browser storage for data persistence.
